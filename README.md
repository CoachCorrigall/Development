# Development

This is a repository that shows some of the work I have developed over the last year. 
As of the end of March, I have two power BI files and a couple SQL files for review.

## Power BI Reports
The NBA reporting package is a project I work on in my free time. This report allows me to combine two things I love dearly - basketball and data.

The building Division Dashboard is a report that I have created for a client over the last year. The data has been anonymized and condensed. Due to time, effort, and a focus on anonymity, some of the data may appear a litle strange (i.e. budgets would consider the entire suite of BUs, not just the ones I have selected), but it is more important to analyze the underlying DAX Measures. I would be happy to explain any aspect of the report in further detail.

## SQL Statements
The account balance SQL statement is a look into how the division dashboard is populated. During my tenure as a consultant, analyst, developer, data person... I have had to work with backend and frontend tools simultaneously. I enjoy having visibility into the solution from beginning to end and realize that some code is better handled in the database and some logic is better handled in Power BI. Due to the time intelligence required for reporting, there was a considerable amount of thought placed into where certain logic exists.
