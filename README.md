# Development

This is a repository that shows some of the work I have developed over the last year. 
As of the end of March, I have two power BI files and a couple SQL files for review.

## Power BI Reports
The NBA reporting package is a project I work on in my free time. This report allows me to combine two things I love dearly - basketball and data.

The building Division Dashboard is a report that I have created for a client over the last year. The data has been anonymized and condensed. Due to time, effort, and a focus on anonymity, some of the data may appear a litle strange (i.e. budgets would consider the entire suite of BUs, not just the ones I have selected), but it is more important to analyze the underlying DAX Measures. I would be happy to explain any aspect of the report in further detail.
