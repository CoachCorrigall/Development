# Development

This is a repository that shows some of the work I have developed over the last year. 
As of the end of March, I have two power BI files and a three SQL files for review.

## Power BI Reports
The NBA reporting package is a project I have developed in my free time. This report allows me to bring together two things I love in life - basketball and data.

The building Division Dashboard is a report that I have developed for a client over the five months. The data has been anonymized and condensed. Due to time, effort, and a focus on anonymity, some of the data may appear slightly strange (i.e. budgets would consider the entire suite of BUs, not just the ones I have selected), but the report can be used to analyze and understand my ability to write DAX Measures. I would be happy to explain any aspect of the report in further detail.

## SQL Statements
The account balance SQL statement is a look into how the division dashboard is populated. During my tenure as a consultant, analyst, developer, data person... I have had to work with backend and frontend tools simultaneously. I enjoy having visibility into the solution from beginning to end and realize that some code is better handled in the database and some logic is better handled in Power BI. Due to the time intelligence required for reporting, there was a considerable amount of thought placed into where certain logic exists.

The build SQL source statement code was a project that a group of developers (including myself) worked on together to support the initiative of loading tables from a source into a target in a more systematic way. We relied on the use of meta data in order to create statements needed to pull data from the source. Most of the underlying meta data tables in the code are simple create table statements that mimic the sys.<insert_table> columns from a SQL server source.
